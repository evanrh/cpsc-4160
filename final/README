CONTROLS:
Up - Jump; can be held to "fly"
Right - move right
Left - move left

The state machine that my player uses consists for 4 states:
   - idle
   - jumping
   - moving right
   - moving left
Each of these states has an animation, except for jumping.
The state of the player is updated any time an input is read, or when the player reaches the ground after jumping.
